Bookmarks (in progress)
=========

***I've only just started building and testing this, so don't fork yet***

This will be a tool to create and host your own bookmarks, built in Jekyll.

An example of a site using this is http://styleguides.io

## To do:
- Add tag support
- Add category support
- Create a bookmarklet to add via GitHub
